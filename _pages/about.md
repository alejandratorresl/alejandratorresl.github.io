I'm an aspiring Economics PhD student from Bogot√°, Colombia. I currently work as a Predoctoral research assistant at the Economics division of [Columbia Business School](https://www.gsb.columbia.edu/). 

I'm interested in macroeconomic development, specially on labor and spatial economics, growth and climate change. I hold a bachelor's degree and a master's in Economics from [Universidad de los Andes](https://economia.uniandes.edu.co/)

Previously, I worked as research assistant at the [Center for Sustainable Finance](https://cfs.uniandes.edu.co/es/) at Universidad de los Andes, and at the Research Department of the [Inter-American Development Bank](https://www.iadb.org/en/knowledge-resources/research-idb).
