I'm an aspiring Economics PhD student from Bogot√°, Colombia. I currently work as a Predoctoral research assistant at the Economics division of Columbia Business School. 

I'm interested in macroeconomic development, specially on labor and spatial economics, growth and climate change. I hold a bachelor's degree and a master's in Economics from Universidad de los Andes
